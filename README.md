# PiggyPocket

Welcome to PiggyPocket! PiggyPocket is a financial management application that helps you track your expenses, create customized reports, and manage your budget effectively.

## Project Description

PiggyPocket allows you to record your financial transactions, organize them by category, view detailed statistics, and generate customized reports. The application provides a comprehensive overview of your finances, enabling you to make informed decisions and improve your financial situation.

## Features

- Recording financial transactions
- Organizing transactions by category
- Detailed statistics on expenses and earnings
- Generation of customized reports
- Monthly budget management
- Intuitive and user-friendly interface

## Usage

On the main page /home, you can view charts representing some information about the executed transactions. To add new transactions, you need to go to the transactions page.

On the transactions page, click on "Add Transaction" (On mobile, open the menu), and you can also add filters to filter transactions.

To edit a transaction, you can click the appropriate button (on mobile, click on the transaction).

The same goes for deleting a transaction.

On the monthly summary page, you can see a month-by-month summary of the transactions made, and if configured, by clicking on a summary, you can generate a report via GPT that analyzes the expenses.

In the settings page, you can view user data, export data in JSON format, add predefined transactions, and delete the account.

Also, on the settings page, you can generate a token to use the API. The token can only be viewed once but can be regenerated.

## API Documentation

The complete documentation for PiggyPocket APIs is available in the [API.md](API.md) file. This file provides details on all available API endpoints, required parameters, expected responses, and other important information for integration with the application.

## GPT Server Configuration

PiggyPocket requires a GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) server for natural language processing to generate customized reports. Before running the application, it's necessary to configure the GPT server to respond to the `POST /api/prompt` endpoint with a JSON object containing a `response` property corresponding to the response generated by GPT.

Here's how to configure the GPT server to integrate it with PiggyPocket:

1. Install the GPT server in your local environment or on a remote server following the instructions provided by the provider or the GPT project you are using.
2. Ensure that the GPT server is running correctly and is reachable via an API endpoint.
3. Configure the GPT server URL in the PiggyPocket application by modifying the environment variable `GPT_SERVER` in the `.env` file.

   ```
   GPT_SERVER=http://your_gpt_server_address
   ```

   Replace `http://your_gpt_server_address` with the actual URL of the GPT server.

4. Verify that the GPT server responds to the `POST /api/prompt` endpoint with a JSON object containing a `response` property. This property will represent the response generated by GPT based on the provided prompt.

   Example of a correct GPT server response:

   ```json
   {
     "response": "Your response generated by GPT."
   }
   ```

   Ensure that the GPT server is configured properly to respond in this format.

Once the GPT server and the PiggyPocket application are correctly configured with the GPT server URL, you will be able to generate customized reports using the artificial intelligence of the GPT server.

You can find an example of a working GPT server in the [GPT-SERVER.md](GPT-SERVER.md) file.
